A project used to demonstrate a few issues with Karate in a jar packaged by Spring Boot.

Build with `./gradlew clean build`. This will create a jar in `build/libs`.
Launch the packaged application with `java -jar build/libs/karate-spring-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`, see what's inside with `jar -tf build/libs/karate-spring-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
